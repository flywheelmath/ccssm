# ccssm
Data tools for the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics

## Dependency graph

The Common Core Mathematics standards and the logical dependencies and conceptual connections between them are represented by the dependency graph: [https://flywheelmath.github.io/ccssm/](https://flywheelmath.github.io/ccssm/)

## JSON files

The ccssm-k8.json and ccssm-hs.json contain the data of (most of) the Common Core Mathematics standards for K-8 and High School, respectively.
The file ccssm-dependencies.json lists logical dependencies and conceptual connections between the various standards.

### CSV files

For ease of use, the data from each of these JSON files is contained in the analogous CSV files.

### Python scripts

There is a script to convert between JSON and CSV formats.
There is also a script to extract the data from the JSON files into a format that can be used to generate a dependency graph.
